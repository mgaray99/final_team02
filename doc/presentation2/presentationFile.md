## SPRINT #1 PLANNED FEATURES COMPLETION:

#### COMPLETED
* Be able to load a level of a platform game
* Move player around using arrow keys and jump with spacebar
* Have Entity collision (i.e. Player doesn't fall thru floor)
* Use clear model, view, controller

* Model: work on developing the Entity hierarchy
* Model: build Entity collision
* Model: load a level of a platform game
* Model: design the file that contains the platform game's data
* Model: build Entity collision

* View: Make splash screen
* Controller: Build buttons
* Controller: move player around screen and jump with spacebar
* Controller: pause game with P
* View: build link between Controller and View
* View: build css flexibility
* View: build language flexibility

#### INCOMPLETE
* Developing a win/lose condition reaching a point in the level
* Model: configure goal state
* Model: configure a file to hold the changeable jumping characteristics
* Model: develop the correct physics for jumping

#### ANALYSIS
Communication certainly helped us implement most of the features, as members responsible for one
side of the project would let the other side know what they needed from them. However, we
still fell behind a fair amount due to underestimating the time it would take to implement
certain features and incorporating that into our schedules in general.

## SIGNIFICANT EVENT FOR THIS SPRINT:
A significant event that occurred during this sprint was the inclusion of a way to save
the game, which was not originally a part of our plan. As Alex created a decoder
map for CSV file keys to their corresponding entity type values, it became obvious
that we could use it to convert the current level state into a save file, like one of the tasks
for Simulation. We learned that the inclusion of additional features can be made easy
simply by how certain team members decided to accomplish implementing planned features.
