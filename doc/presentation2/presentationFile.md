* Use clear model, view, controller

* Model: work on developing the Entity hierarchy
* Model: build Entity collision

#### INCOMPLETE
* Developing a win/lose condition reaching a point in the level
* Model: configure goal state
* Model: configure a file to hold the changeable jumping characteristics
* Model: develop the correct physics for jumping

#### ANALYSIS
Communication certainly helped us implement most of the features, as members responsible for one
side of the project would let the other side know what they needed from them. However, we
still fell behind a fair amount due to underestimating the time it would take to implement
certain features and incorporating that into our schedules in general.

## SIGNIFICANT EVENT FOR THIS SPRINT:
A significant event that occurred during this sprint was the inclusion of a way to save
the game, which was not originally a part of our plan. As Alex created a decoder
map for CSV file keys to their corresponding entity type values, it became obvious
that we could use it to convert the current level state into a save file, like one of the tasks
for Simulation. We learned that the inclusion of additional features can be made easy
simply by how certain team members decided to accomplish implementing planned features.

## TEAMWORK AND COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:
Teamwork and communication between team members has been pretty solid. We rely on platforms like imessage and Slack for quick questions and rescheduling interviews. Our team also meets up frequently, about 5 times a week, to provide updates on the project, reflect on our progress and plan ahead. Team members show interest in the project and are always quick to respond to questions and voice out their opinions. Also with the division of the project into backend and frontend enhances collaboration between each half of the team.


## PLAN FOR SPRINT #2:
Our plan for Sprint #2 is basically enhancing the Mario game we started implementing in Sprint #1. Features to be implemented include:
- Making the game scrollable: autoscroll, follow the player scroll type
- Adding additional levels
- Applying different textures to features of the game
- Adding functional Power ups.
- Making different types of Blocks: Breakable, Unbreakable, Powerup, Damage
- Making enemies/oppositions
