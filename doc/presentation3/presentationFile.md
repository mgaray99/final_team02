#### ANALYSIS
Overall, we did a pretty good job so far this sprint. We tackled a lot of major features and got
them done, making us feel confident we will have everything we planned on implementing
done by Complete. The games feel playable, and the various aspects of gameplay can be configured
adequately. 

## SIGNIFICANT EVENT FOR THIS SPRINT:
A significant event for this sprint was actually getting the game to scroll. Scrolling is a major
feature of platformer games and being able to implement this feature marked an important milestone
for our team. Another significant event was being able to put the three different types of
platformer games (Mario, Flappy Bird, Doodle Jump) together and giving the player the ability to 
switch between each version of the game. This was a major feature in Sprint #3 which we presumed
was complicated and being able to implement this feature in Sprint #2 gives us the confidence
we'll be able to complete all features we planned on implementing for the game.

## TEAMWORK AND COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:
Teamwork and communication between team members this week is still as strong as last week's with
frequent communication via text and Slack and regular scheduled meetings. A new addition, however,
is the opening and closing of issues on GitHub. This informs team members on major features each 
person is working on and enables the team keep track of each other's progress.


## PLAN FOR SPRINT #3:
- Be able to play at least three types of platformer games: Mario, Flappy Bird, Doodle Jump
- Switch between different versions of the game
